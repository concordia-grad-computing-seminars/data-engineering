# Introduction to data analysis
This covers the data analysis semester of the seminar [Applied Numerical Computing II](https://www.concordia.ca/academics/graduate/calendar/current/gina-cody-school-of-engineering-and-computer-science-courses/mechanical-industrial-and-aerospace-engineering-courses.html) offered in [Mechanical, Industrial and Aerospace Engineering](https://www.concordia.ca/ginacody/mechanical-industrial-aerospace-eng.html) at [Concordia University](https://www.concordia.ca/).

During this one semester seminar, targeted to an audience with engineering background but little to no experience in modern data processing, we give a first introduction to some selected concepts of data processing. 

## Topics

1. Development environment: JupyterHub and GitHub
2. Introduction to Python: functions, classes
3. Introduction to data processing: NumPy, Pandas, DataFrames, MatPlotLib
4. Regression models: Linear and multi-linear regression
5. Model selection and regularization: over/under fitting, re-sampling methods
6. Classification models: K-nearest neighbors, support vector machines, logistic regression
7. Tree based methods: Decision trees as classifiers/regression models, boosting, random forests

## Development environment

Use either

* JupyterHub server from the Gina Cody School of Engineering
* [Jupyter/JupyerLab](https://jupyter.org/) installed on your machine
* [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)
* [![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/concordia-grad-computing-seminars/data-engineering.git/HEAD)
