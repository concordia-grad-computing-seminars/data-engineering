During this one semester semainr, targeted to an audiance with engineering background but little to no experience in modern data processing, we give a first introduction to some concepts of data processing. 

## Topics

1. Development environment: JupyterHub and GitHub
2. Introduction to Python: functions, classes
3. Introduction to data processing: NumPy, Pandas, DataFrames, MatPlotLib
4. Regression models: Linear and multilinear regression
5. Model selection and regularization: over/under fitting, re-sampling methods
